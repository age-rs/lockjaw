   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `default`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `Default`
   = note: this error originates in a macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
